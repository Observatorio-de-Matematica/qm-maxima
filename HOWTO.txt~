Maxima 3rd-party package instructions

This template holds skeleton documentation files for your package as
well as skeleton .mac and .lisp files for your source code.

For your package documentation to be visible once you load the package
you must create the documentation in the doc/ folder using a script
file provided there. Detailed instructions follow.

1. Name your package. For this howto let's assume your package name is
"PKG".

2. Put your code in the top level directory which you should
rename PKG-maxima.

3. Rename the source files PKG.mac and PKG.lisp. Put all of your
source code in these files. You may have additional files but you
should 'load' them from the PKG.mac file.

4. In the PKG-maxima/doc/ directory edit the PKG.texi file. Heed the
warnings in this file about keeping the structure as it is, otherwise
'makeinfo' may fail.

5.
