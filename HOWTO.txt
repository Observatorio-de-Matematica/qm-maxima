Maxima 3rd-party package instructions:

This template holds skeleton documentation files for your package as
well as skeleton .mac and .lisp files for your source code.

For your package documentation to be visible once you load the package
you must create the documentation in the doc/ folder using a script
file provided there. Detailed instructions follow.

For the documentation to work correctly you need to have the Maxima
source installed on your computer because some of the utilities that
generate the documentation indexing are only contained within the
Maxima source.

1. Name your package. For this howto let's assume your package name is
"PKG". Edit the file "PACK-NAME" to contain your package name. You
must do this for the scripts to work. You should be able to see:

$ cat PACK-NAME
$ PKG

2. Edit the LICENSE file to whatever license you like.

3. Put your code in the top level directory which you should
rename PKG-maxima.

4. Rename the source files PKG.mac and PKG.lisp. Put all of your
source code in these files. You may have additional files but you
should 'load' them from the PKG.mac file.

5. In the PKG-maxima/doc/ directory edit the PKG.texi file. Heed the
warnings in this file about keeping the structure as it is, otherwise
'makeinfo' may fail.

Note: Examples have the following format that must be followed
exactly.

@example
@group
(%i1) command here;
(%i2) another command here;
@end group
@end example

If your example needs the output of a previous command it MUST be in
the same '@group'.

You do not have to cut and paste output from a Maxima session into
your PKG.texi file. It is fine for your .texi file to contain only the
input commands. The output will be generated automatically using the
script file PKG-maxima/doc/regen_examples.sh. To run this script do:

$ ./regen_examples.sh

The script will process the different 'groups' in PKG.texi and
place the output in "regen.texi". Before you overwrite your original
PKG.texi file YOU SHOULD DO:

$ diff PKG.texi regen.texi

and make sure that the only lines getting replaced are from the examples.
If your PKG.texi file is missing "@end group" then 'regen_examples' will
not process your .texi file correctly.

6. In the PKG-maxima/doc/ directory do:

Set the pathname to the source-code for Maxima by editing the file
MAXIMA-SOURCE in the PKG-maxima/doc directory. For example, if you
cloned from Sourceforge you might have:

$ cat MAXIMA-SOURCE
$ /home/packages/SOURCE/maxima-code

Now, issue:

$ ./create_docs.sh

This should create PKG.info, PKG.pdf, a PKG_html/ directory containing
html-related doc files, a text file ../README.md, as well as some
other index files.

From the main PKG.texi file it will also generate a file
../rtest_PKG.mac containing Maxima tests using the examples
you use in your PKG.texi file.
